        <h1>Chain Letter</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">$Letter, The first ERC-20 onchain message token</p>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>
"This letter originated in England and has brought good fortune to those who<br>
receive it as it makes its way around the world once a year. This letter has<br>
now been passed on to you, and it must leave your hands within 24 hours. You<br>
are required to send 16 copies of this letter to people who need good luck.<br>
While it may seem superstitious, it is indeed true.<br><br>
In 1930, a man named HGXWCH in England received this letter. He instructed his<br>
secretary to make copies and send them out. A few days later, he won the<br>
lottery and received 2 billion. Someone else received this letter but forgot<br>
that it had to leave his hands within 24 hours. Soon after, he was fired from<br>
his job. Realizing his mistake, he sent out 16 copies of the letter and later<br>
secured a good job. President Kennedy of the United States received this<br>
letter but discarded it. Nine days later, he was assassinated.<br><br>
Remember, if you send out 16 copies of this letter, you will receive good<br>
fortune. If you do not, misfortune will follow. And under no circumstances<br>
should you discard or deface this letter. Send out 16 copies. Good fortune and<br>
wealth will come to those who receive this letter."

        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
The world's oldest meme, the chain letter, is being reborn on the blockchain.<br>
Through onchain messages only possible with ERC-20.<br><br>
One million active Base addresses with at least one meme coin transaction<br>
have been registered in the post office ledger. The goal is simple:<br>
All registered active Base addresses in the ledger will send and receive lucky letters.<br><br>
When you buy 100 Letter Tokens on Uniswap, you receive a lucky letter that is <br>
permanently recorded on the blockchain along with the token.<br>
Simultaneously, a lucky letter is sent to a randomly selected active address<br>
from the ledger. No one would choose misfortune over luck. So the chain letter<br>
that started with 16 messages will grow exponentially, conquering the Base chain.<br>
When all active addresses receive a letter, the market cap will reach billions.<br><br>
※ In 1935, hundreds of thousands of send-a-dime chain letters piled up in<br>
just one Denver post office. 1 million isn't such a large number in comparison.

        <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
        <div class="tokenomics">
            <p>
3/3 tax. Tax will be used as postage costs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Reward</h2>
        <div class="reward">
            <p>
$Letter is not a Ponzi scheme like the "send-a-dime" trend from a century ago.<br>
We don't offer unsustainable rewards to recipients; the only promise is a billion<br>
market cap achieved through collective will. However, following ancient tradition,<br>
lucky users who diligently send 16 letters should receive a modest reward<br>
before the common goal is achieved.<br><br>
The last digit of an ERC-20 address is determined according to the<br>
hexadecimal system, which uses numbers 0-9 and letters A-F. Therefore, the<br>
last digit of an EVM address will be one of the following 16 possible<br>
values;<br><br>
Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9<br>
Letters: A, B, C, D, E, F<br><br>
When you purchase 100 LETTER tokens, a lucky letter is sent to one of the<br>
million active BASE addresses. If you send 16 lucky letters, there will be<br>
at least one match where the last digit of your address matches the<br>
recipient's. When the last digit of both addresses matches, the goddess of<br>
luck will reward you with 6 LETTER tokens, which is double the purchase tax,<br>
following ancient tradition.

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <div class="roadmap">
            <p>
Phase 1: 10,000 letters sent. Those who haven't received a letter suffer<br>
from FOMO.<br><br>
Phase 2: 100,000 letters sent. Luck devours misfortune.<br><br>
Phase 3: 1,000,000 letters sent. Marketcap reaches $1B
