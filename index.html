        <h1>Chain Letter</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">$Letter, The first ERC-20 onchain message token</p>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>
"This letter originated in England and has brought good fortune to those who receive it as it makes its way around the world once a year. This letter has now been passed on to you, and it must leave your hands within 24 hours. You are required to send 16 copies of this letter to people who need good luck. While it may seem superstitious, it is indeed true.<br><br>
In 1930, a man named HGXWCH in England received this letter. He instructed his secretary to make copies and send them out. A few days later, he won the lottery and received 2 billion. Someone else received this letter but forgot that it had to leave his hands within 24 hours. Soon after, he was fired from his job. Realizing his mistake, he sent out 16 copies of the letter and later secured a good job. President Kennedy of the United States received this letter but discarded it. Nine days later, he was assassinated.<br><br>
Remember, if you send out 16 copies of this letter, you will receive good fortune. If you do not, misfortune will follow. And under no circumstances should you discard or deface this letter. Send out 16 copies. Good fortune and wealth will come to those who receive this letter."

        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
The world's oldest meme, the chain letter, is being reborn on the blockchain. Through onchain messages only possible with ERC-20.<br><br>
One million active Base addresses with at least one meme coin transaction have been registered in the post office ledger. The goal is simple: All registered active Base addresses in the ledger will send and receive lucky letters.<br><br>
When you buy $50 worth of Letter tokens on Uniswap, you receive a lucky letter that is permanently recorded on the blockchain along with the token. Simultaneously, a lucky letter is sent to a randomly selected active address from the ledger. No one would choose misfortune over luck. So the chain letter that started with 16 messages will grow exponentially, conquering the Base chain. When all active addresses receive a letter, the market cap will reach billions.<br><br>
※ In 1935, hundreds of thousands of send-a-dime chain letters piled up in just one Denver post office. 1 million isn't such a large number in comparison.

        <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
        <div class="tokenomics">
            <p>
Total Supply : 1 billion<br><br>
LP : 65%<br>
Reword Pool : 35%<br>
Tax : 3/3<br><br>
Reward structure designed to be at least 0.5%, so the actual tax is 2.5/3<br><br>
Tax will be used as postage costs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Reward</h2>
        <div class="reward">
            <p>
$Letter is not a Ponzi scheme like the "send-a-dime" trend from a century ago. We don't offer unsustainable rewards to recipients; the only promise is a billion market cap achieved through collective will. However, following ancient tradition, lucky users who diligently send 16 letters should receive a modest reward before the common goal is achieved.<br><br>
The last digit of an ERC-20 address is determined according to the hexadecimal system, which uses numbers 0-9 and letters A-F. Therefore, the last digit of an EVM address will be one of the following 16 possible values;<br><br>
Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9<br>
Letters: A, B, C, D, E, F<br><br>
When you buy $50 worth of Letter tokens, a lucky letter is sent to one of the million active BASE addresses. So if you send 16 lucky letters, there will be at least one match where the last digit of your address matches the recipient's. When the last digit of both addresses matches, the goddess of luck will reward you with $15 worth LETTER tokens which is x10 of the purchase tax, following ancient tradition.

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <div class="roadmap">
            <p>
Phase 1: 10,000 letters sent. Those who haven't received a letter suffer from FOMO.<br><br>
Phase 2: 100,000 letters sent. Luck devours misfortune.<br><br>
Phase 3: 1,000,000 letters sent. Marketcap reaches $1B
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Note</h2>
        <div class="note">
            <p>
1. In order to send chain letters smoothly and fairly, the number of letters required for sending and the amount of rewards are automatically and precisely adjusted according to the price.<br><br>
2. To ensure fair reward distribution, letters will only be sent to those who buy tokens through authorized routers. MEV or custom routers will not receive letters or rewards.<br><br>
3. We recommend registering your wallet on Cielo before buying $LETTER<br><br>
